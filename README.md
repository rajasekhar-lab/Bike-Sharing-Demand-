Introduction--

BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced a decline in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To prepare for a surge in demand post-lockdown, BoomBikes aims to understand the factors affecting bike rentals and predict future demand.

Dataset--

The dataset includes daily bike rental counts along with various features such as weather conditions, seasons, holidays, and more. The target variable is cnt, which represents the total number of bike rentals.

Steps--

Data Understanding and Loading:-
We start by loading the dataset and inspecting its structure to understand the types of data and the presence of any missing values.

Preprocessing Steps:-
We drop unnecessary columns (casual, registered, dteday) and map categorical variables (like season and weathersit) to their corresponding string values. Dummy variables are created for categorical features with more than two categories to ensure proper model interpretation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-
Univariate Analysis:
We analyze the distribution of each variable to understand its characteristics and detect any anomalies.
Bivariate Analysis:
We examine relationships between individual features and the target variable to identify potential predictors.
Multivariate Analysis:
We analyze the interactions between multiple variables to uncover complex relationships in the data.

Train-Test Split:-
The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Missing Value Imputation:-
Any missing values in the dataset are handled appropriately to ensure the model's accuracy is not compromised.

Scaling:-
Features are rescaled to ensure that they are on a similar scale, which helps improve the performance of the model.

Feature Selection:-
We use a combination of automated (Recursive Feature Elimination, RFE) and manual (p-value and Variance Inflation Factor, VIF) methods to select the most relevant features for the model.

Model Building:-
We build the final multiple linear regression model using the selected features.

Model Evaluation:-
The model is evaluated using R-squared and Adjusted R-squared metrics to assess its performance.

Conclusion--
This project provided insights into the factors affecting bike demand and built a multiple linear regression model to predict future demand. The model can help BoomBikes strategize and meet customer demand effectively.
